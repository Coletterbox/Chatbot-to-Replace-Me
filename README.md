# Chatbot to Replace Me

## https://coletterbox.github.io/Chatbot-to-Replace-Me/

### Inspired by my predictive text's weird, almost insulting caricature of me, here is a chatbot that can take over the role of being me.

#### Note to self: The other half of this is stored locally.

## Right now it can:

- make small talk (just like me!)
- remember your name (this is less realistic)
- answer questions about what I ate
